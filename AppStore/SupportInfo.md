## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: What files does USBCleaner delete?**
A: USBCleaner targets hidden system files created by macOS, such as `.DS_Store`, `._*` resource fork files, and `.Trashes`. It does not touch your personal documents, photos, or videos.

**Q: Is it safe to delete these files?**
A: Yes. These files are metadata used by macOS (e.g., to store folder view settings). Deleting them is safe and often necessary when using the drive on non-Apple devices. macOS will simply recreate them if needed when you reconnect the drive.

**Q: The app says "Permission Denied". What do I do?**
A: Ensure you have granted USBCleaner permission to access Removable Volumes in your Mac's System Settings > Privacy & Security > Files and Folders.
