            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <h3>What files does USBCleaner delete?</h3>
            <p>USBCleaner targets hidden system files created by macOS, such as <code>.DS_Store</code>, <code>._*</code>
                resource fork files, and <code>.Trashes</code>. It does not touch your personal documents, photos, or
                videos.</p>

            <h3>Is it safe to delete these files?</h3>
            <p>Yes. These files are metadata used by macOS (e.g., to store folder view settings). Deleting them is safe
                and often necessary when using the drive on non-Apple devices. macOS will simply recreate them if needed
                when you reconnect the drive.</p>

            <h3>The app says "Permission Denied". What do I do?</h3>
            <p>Ensure you have granted USBCleaner permission to access Removable Volumes in your Mac's <strong>System
                    Settings > Privacy & Security > Files and Folders</strong>.</p>
